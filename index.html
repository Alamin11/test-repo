    <h1>Git basic commands</h1>
    <pre>
        Step1: Create a destined folder and open terminal there 
        Step2: Use "git init" command to initialize git 
        Step3: Use "git add ." to stage all the files to be added to git repo
        Step4: Now commit all the files using "git commit -m 'commit message' "
        Step5: So with the above commands all our files are ready to send in a remote repo. As per our convenience we will create a new repository on github
        Step6: Meanwhile we can change our branch master to main using "git branch -M main"
        Step7: Now add the remote repository with our local repo using "git remote add origin remoteRepoURL"
        Step8: Finally its time to send or local repo to remote repo . To do so use "git push -u origin main"
    </pre>

            <h4>Git Branching</h4>
            Step1: To show the branches use "git branch"
            step2: Creating a branch without switching "git branch new-branch-name"
            step3: Creating branch and switching into it "git checkout -b new-branch-name"
            step4:Switching branch "git checkout existing-branch-name" 
        </pre>

    <h2>Git merging two branches</h2>
    <pre>
            Before starting to merge we need to push all the changes of our changes
            Step1: Switch to the branch with whom we want to merge using "git checkout branch-name"
            step2: Now merge tow branches using "git merge branch-name"
            step3: Finally again push all the changes to remote repo "git push"
        </pre>
